# Bing Wallpapers

	@sandeep007
   
		Made for fun purpose only, Bing wallpapers are really cool and usually downloading picture of day could be tedious task so this py script can come handy in dowloading 
		the image and setting it as the desktop wallpaper. (For linux)

        NOTE: if this script doesn't work and showing message something like this :
        GLib-GIO-Message: Using the 'memory' GSettings backend.  Your settings will not be saved or shared with other applications

        Try this command: export GIO_EXTRA_MODULES=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gio/modules/
