# Bing Wallpapers

@sandeep007

Made for fun purpose only, Bing wallpapers are really cool and usually downloading picture of day could be tedious task so this py script can come handy in dowloading 
the image and setting it as the desktop wallpaper. (For linux)

NOTE: if this script doesn't work and showing message something like this :
GLib-GIO-Message: Using the 'memory' GSettings backend.  Your settings will not be saved or shared with other applications

Try this command: export GIO_EXTRA_MODULES=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gio/modules/


For a lazy people like me, running the python script can also be considered as 'work', so for this task you can put script on start up that will be automatically update the wallpaper on start-up.
